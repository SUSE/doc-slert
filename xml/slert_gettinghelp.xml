  <command>cset</command> contains a logging application that is invaluable
  for our developers to diagnose problems and find quick solutions. To
  create a log of your issue, use the <option>--log</option>
  option with a file name as an argument to the main cset application. For
  example:
 </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>cset</command> -l logfile.txt set -n <replaceable>newname</replaceable> <replaceable>oldname</replaceable></screen>
 <para>
  If the issue persists and is reproducible, Including this report in your
  bug submission greatly reduces development time. This command saves
  debugging information within the file <filename>logfile.txt</filename>.
