== Contributing

Thank you for contributing to this repo. Please adhere to the following guidelines when creating a pull request:

. Make your pull request against the __main__ branch if you are contributing to the most recent release. This branch is is protected.

. If you are contributing to a previous release, please see _maintenance/_<RELEASENUMBER>_. These branches are also protected.

. Make sure all validation checks are passed, and tag relevant SMEs from the development team (if applicable)
  and members of the SLE-RT doc team: Thomas Schraitle (@tomschr).

  **NOTE:** If your pull request has multiple files and reorganisation changes, please build locally using DAPS or daps2docker
  (see instructions below) to verify and build the files. Travis CI only validates, and does not ensure the XML builds
  are correct.

. Implement any required changes, or fix any merge conflicts if relevant. If you have any questions, ping a documentation team
  member in #team-suse-docs on Slack.


== Editing DocBook

To contribute to the documentation, you need to write DocBook.

* You can learn about DocBook syntax at http://docbook.org/tdg5/en/html .
* SUSE documents are generally built with DAPS (package `daps`) and the
  SUSE XSL Stylesheets (package `suse-xsl-stylesheets`). Ideally, you should
  get these from the repository `Documentation:Tools`. However, slightly
  older versions are also available from the SLE and openSUSE repositories.


== Building documentation

If you are interested in building DAPS documentation (defaulting to HTML and PDF), you can utilize
either DAPS directly or use daps2docker. Both tools only work on Linux.

* Use daps2docker if you use any Linux distribution that includes Docker and Systemd and only want to
  build HTML, PDF, or EPUB and want to be set up as quickly as possible.
* Use DAPS directly if you are using a recent version of openSUSE, and want to use any of the advanced
  features of DAPS, such as building Mobipocket or spell-checking documents.


=== Using daps2docker

1. Install Docker.
2. Clone the daps2docker repository from https://github.com/openSUSE/daps2docker.
3. Within the cloned repository, run `./daps2docker.sh /PATH/TO/DOC-DIR`
   This builds HTML and PDF documents.


=== Using DAPS directly

** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> validate`: Make sure what you have written is
    well-formed XML and valid DocBook 5
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> pdf`: Build a PDF document
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> html`: Build multi-page HTML document
** Learn more at https://opensuse.github.io/daps
