== Branches

**On Sep 12, 2019, we changed to a new branching model. We have
switched the default branch from `develop` to `master`.**

== Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please fork this repository and send
pull requests.

* *Use the master branch* as the basis of your commits/of new feature branches.

* The *develop branch has been deleted* on the server. Do not to push to the `develop` branch.
  Your changes may go lost in the medium term and never make it to the proper branch.


=== How to Update Your Local Repository

If you *created* a local clone or GitHub fork of this repo *before Sep 12, 2019, do the following*:

1. Make sure that your `master` and `develop` branches do not contain any important changes.
  If there are changes on either branch, export them using `git format-patch` or put them on a
  different branch.

1. Go to the master branch: `git checkout master`.


1. To pull the latest changes from the remote repository and to delete references to branches
   that do not exist anymore on the server, run the following command: `git pull --prune`.

1. Delete your local develop branch: `git branch -D develop`.

1. To check for stale local branches, run: `git branch -v`.
   For any branches marked as `[gone]`, check if you still need them. If not, delete them:
   `git branch -D BRANCHNAME`


== Writing DocBook

To contribute to the documentation, you need to write DocBook.

* You can learn about DocBook syntax at http://docbook.org/tdg5/en/html .
* SUSE documents are generally built with DAPS (package `daps`) and the
  SUSE XSL Stylesheets (package `suse-xsl-stylesheets`). Ideally, you should
  get these from the repository `Documentation:Tools`. However, slightly
  older versions are also available from the SLE and openSUSE repositories.
* Basic daps usage:
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> validate`: Make sure what you have written is
    well-formed XML and valid DocBook 5
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> pdf`: Build a PDF
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> html`: Build a HTML
** Learn more at https://opensuse.github.io/daps
